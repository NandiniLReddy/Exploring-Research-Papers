#1.  SPIQA: Scientific Paper Image Question Answering Dataset

The release of the **SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering)** dataset marks a significant advancement in how we interact with scientific literature.

## Key Details:

- **First large-scale QA dataset** designed to interpret complex figures and tables in scientific papers.
- **270,000 questions** spanning various computer science domains.
- Includes data from **25,859 papers** published in **19 leading conferences** between 2018 and 2023.

## How Researchers and Students Can Benefit from SPIQA:

- **Train and evaluate multimodal AI models** that can interpret both text and visuals in scientific papers.
- **Explore the dataset on Hugging Face** for various machine learning and NLP applications.

## Maximizing SPIQAâ€™s Potential:

- Leverage its **multimodal nature** to develop a more comprehensive understanding of research papers.
- Apply the **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy** for improved model performance.
